   <salutation>Dear Sir:</salutation>

   <paragraph>It is our privilege to inform you about our new
      database managed with <bold>XML</bold>. This system
      allows you to reduce the load on your inventory list
      server by having the client machine perform the work of
      sorting and filtering the data.</paragraph>

   <paragraph>The data in an XML element is normalized, so
      plain-text diagrams such as
         /---\
         |   |
         \---/
      will become gibberish.</paragraph>

    <closing>Sincerely</closing>
